# Discord Bot Clean Architecture Pattern
This is a Discord bot project built following the principles of Clean Architecture.


This project is under development. In the future, we will have more basic examples of how to use the application to aid development, such as:

- Role-based authorization.

- Some server functions.

- Basic permission management.

- Bot commands.

- Embed examples.
